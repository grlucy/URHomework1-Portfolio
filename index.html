                <p>I am currently a student at the University of Richmond studying full stack web development. Before returning to university, I was a Senior Communications Specialist at CBRE, a global commercial real estate leader. I worked in the marketing field since 2011 at companies including Second Act Communities, Virginia Beach Community Development Corporation, and Old Dominion University. I also managed my own freelance business, providing services in photography, graphic design, and web design.</p>
                <p>Raised in Virginia Beach, I lived in Williamsburg, Norfolk, and Baltimore before moving to Richmond in spring 2018. I graduated with a B.S. Business Administration with a major in marketing from Old Dominion University in 2012.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I'm playing video games, dancing, traveling, or lazing around with my two cats.</p>
